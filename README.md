# Snake Client Project
The Snake Game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake-like creature that grows in length by eating pieces of food. The goal of the game is to navigate the snake around the game board, avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body, while consuming as much food as possible to maximize the snake's length.
